After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use the definition of the derivative to develop shortcut rules to find the derivatives of constants and constant multiples.
	\item Use the definition of the derivative to develop shortcut rules to find the derivatives of powers of $x$.
	\item Use the definition of the derivative to develop shortcut rules to find the derivatives of sums and differences of functions.
        \item Compute the derivative of polynomials.
     \end{itemize}
