      \textbf{Calculus} is about the very large, the very small, and how things
      change. The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract
      ends up explaining the real world.

      \textbf{On the cover} we see a time lapse photograph of the star
      \textit{Polaris}, commonly known as the ``North Star.''  If one
      imagines a line drawn from the South Pole to the North Pole that
      extends infinitely into space, the star \textit{Polaris} appears very
      nearly on this line. Hence as the Earth rotates, we the
      inhabitants of Earth, see the stars rotate around
      \textit{Polaris}. The circular star-trails in this photograph
      are formed by the accumulated light, over a period of time, collected
      the camera's light-sensor. This process of accumulating light
      can be described precisely using the language of calculus as an
      ``integral,'' something that will be introduced in this book.

      \textbf{The graphs} shown at the bottom lead us though a
      standard process for evaluating the left-most intgeral. We
      transform using the equality
      \[
      \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(g) \ d g = \int_a^b f(g(x)) g'(x) \ d x
      \]
      first working right-to-left and then working from
      left-to-right. Through this sort of manipulation, you will be
      able to integrate \textbf{any} function of the form $p(x)/q(x)$
      where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials, assuming you can factor $q$
      into linear and quadratic factors.
