      \textbf{Calculus} is about the very large, the very small, and how things
      change. The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract
      ends up explaining the real world.

      \textbf{On the cover} we see a time lapse photograph of the star
      \textit{Polaris}, commonly known as the ``North Star.''  If one
      imagines a line drawn from the South Pole to the North Pole that
      extends infinitely into space, the star \textit{Polaris} appears very
      nearly on this line. Hence as the Earth rotates, we the
      inhabitants of Earth, see the stars rotate around
      \textit{Polaris}. The circular star-trails in this photograph
      are formed by the accumulated light, over a period of time, collected
      the camera's light-sensor. This process of accumulating light
      can be described precisely using the language of calculus as an
      ``integral,'' something that will be introduced in this book.

      \textbf{The graph} shown at the bottom is suggestive of the
      Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The main plot is $y=f(x)$, the
      dashed plot shows the rate that $f$ is changing, $y=f'(x)$. The
      rectangles between the dashed plot and the axis show the
      (signed) area accumulated by the rate. The piecewise-linear
      curve is an approximation of the function $f$, generated by
      looking at average rates over a given step-size. The dashed
      rectangles show the average rise and run over the step-size. It
      is our sincerest hope that this helps show that:
      \begin{quote}
        \textbf{Accumulated rates of a function are equal to the value of the
        function.}
      \end{quote}
      This is the essence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and
      one must not underestimate its strength and utility.
