      \textbf{Calculus} is about the very large, the very small, and how things
      change. The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract
      ends up explaining the real world.

      \textbf{On the cover} we see a time lapse photograph of the star
      \textit{Polaris}, commonly known as the ``North Star.''  If one
      imagines a line drawn from the South Pole to the North Pole that
      extends infinitely into space, the star \textit{Polaris} appears very
      nearly on this line. Hence as the Earth rotates, we the
      inhabitants of Earth, see the stars rotate around
      \textit{Polaris}. The circular star-trails in this photograph
      are formed by the accumulated light, over a period of time, collected
      the camera's light-sensor. This process of accumulating light
      can be described precisely using the language of calculus as an
      ``integral,'' something that will be introduced in this book.

      \textbf{The graph} shown at the bottom is showing successive
      Taylor approximations of the function $f(x) = \sin(x)/x$. You
      will learn how to approximate functions with polynomials,
      allowing you to approximate the solution of difficult problems
      with ease.
