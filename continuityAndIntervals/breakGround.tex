Here we see a dialogue where students discuss solving inequalities 
as they learned in precalculus.

\maketitle


Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, remember when our precalculus instructor showed us how to solve inequalities?
\item[Riley] Yep, but it seemed like it was just another method we were told to memorize!
\item[Devyn] Right, but she said we would understand the method once we took calculus.
\item[Riley] Sure, but didn't she say that about everything we learned?
\end{dialogue}

In precalculus, you learned to solve an inequality like 
$$(x-2)(x+3) > 0$$
What was the method that you used?
