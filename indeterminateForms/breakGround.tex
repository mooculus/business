Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):


\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hey Riley, remember
  \[
  \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{x^2}{4x}?
  \]
\item[Riley] It is equal to $0$!
  \item[Devyn] Yeah, but now I'm not sure I was right.
  \item[Riley] Dividing by zero is usually a bad idea.
  \item[Devyn] You are right. I will never do it again! Also, don't
    tell anyone about this conversation.
  \item[Riley] What conversation?
  \item[Devyn] Exactly.
\end{dialogue}



\begin{problem}
  Consider the function
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{x}{x}.
  \]
  \[
  f(0) = \answer{DNE}\qquad\lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = \answer{1}.
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Consider the function
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{4x}{x}.
  \]
  \[
  f(0) = \answer{DNE}\qquad\lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = \answer{4}.
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Consider the function
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{x}{-3x}.
  \]
  \[
  f(0) = \answer{DNE}\qquad\lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = \answer{-1/3}.
  \]
\end{problem}
