Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, check out this plot:
  \begin{image}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            xmin=-6.75,xmax=6.75,ymin=-1.5,ymax=1.5,
            axis lines=center,
            ticks=none,
            width=6in,
            height=3in,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]        
          \addplot [very thick, penColor, samples=100,smooth, domain=(-6.75:6.75)] {-sin(deg(x))};
          \addlegendentry{$A$};
          \addplot [very thick, dashed,penColor, samples=100,smooth, domain=(-6.75:6.75)] {cos(deg(x))};
          \addlegendentry{$B$};
          \addplot [very thick, dotted,penColor, samples=100,smooth, domain=(-6.75:6.75)] {sin(deg(x))};
          \addlegendentry{$C$};
        \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
\item[Riley] Whoa, that looks cool!
\item[Devyn] I know! Anyway, someone told me that this was a graph
  of a function, its derivative, and the derivative of the
  derivative.  Which one is which?
\item[Riley] Hmmmmm. I'm not sure.
