# Textbook TODO:

* In [Understanding functions](understandingFunctions/)
add a problem with a graph, and finding f^{-1}(2) on a restricted domain.

* In [Limit laws](limitLaws/) add more graphs to squeeze theorem.

# Textbook overview
Each lecture will have a
	* welcome (Short paragraph/video along with outcomes)
	* breakGround (Devyn and Riley)
	* multiple digIn's (sections of the chapter)
	* collaborate (recitations)
	* reinforce (problems)
