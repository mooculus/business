\begin{exercise}
A spherical meteorite enters the earth's atmosphere and burns up radially at a rate proportional to its surface area with constant of proportionality $\alpha<0$. We shall show that its radius decreases at a constant rate. 

First, given a sphere of radius $r$, recall the formula for its volume, $V$.
\[
V=\answer{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}
\]
\begin{exercise}
Similarly, recall that the surface area $A$ of a sphere of radius $r$ is given by
\[
A=\answer{4\pi r^2}
\]
\begin{exercise}
Since the meteorite burns up radially at a rate proportional to its surface area $A$ with constant of proportionality $\alpha$, 
\[
\dfrac{dV}{dt}=\answer{\alpha A}
\]
\begin{exercise}
Now compute $\frac{dV}{dt}$ and express it in terms of the surface area $A$ and $r'=\frac{dr}{dt}$. (If you \textit{must} enter a derivative of the function $r$ with respective time, simply write $r'$, not $\frac{dr}{dt})
\[
\frac{dV}{dt}=\answer{A r'}
\]
\begin{exercise}
Equating these two expressions obtained for $\frac{dV}{dt}$, we find that $\alpha A=A r'$. If the meteorite is still burning up at a time $t$, then $A(t)\ne 0$. Therefore for such $t$,
\[
r'(t)=\answer{\alpha}
\]
Thus, $\frac{dr}{dt}$ is constant.
