Two young mathematicians discuss whether integrals are defined properly.

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I like integrals.
\item[Riley] I feel fancy when I make an integral sign.
\item[Devyn] I know! An integral computes the signed area between a curve
  $y=f(x)$ and the $x$-axis. But why \textit{signed} area? Maybe we should
  just compute plain old area.
\item[Riley] Makes sense to me!
\item[Deyvn] Unless\dots maybe there are other applications where
  ``signed'' area makes more sense.
\end{dialogue}

One really great way to think about integrals is that they
``accumulate rates.''

\begin{problem}
  Write down as many examples of ``rates'' and ``accumulated rates'' as you can. For example:
  \begin{quote}
    $5$ miles per hour is a rate, and $5$ miles is then an accumulated rate. 
  \end{quote}
  \begin{freeResponse}
  \end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}
