\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a velocity function, calculate displacement and distance traveled.
	\item Given a velocity function, find the position function.
	\item Given an acceleration function, find the velocity function.
	\item Understand the difference between displacement and distance traveled.
	\item Understand the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration.
	%\item Calculate net change and future value.
	%\item Understand how the net change and future value of a function are related to that function's derivative.
\end{itemize}
