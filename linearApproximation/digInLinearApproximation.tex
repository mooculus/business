%\section{Linear approximation}

Given a function, a \textit{linear approximation} is a fancy phrase
for something you already know:
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The derivative is the slope of the tangent line.}
\end{quote}
Except in this section, the emphasis is on the \textbf{line}.

\begin{definition}\index{linear approximation}
If $f$ is a differentiable function at $x=a$, then a \textbf{linear
  approximation} for $f$ at $x=a$ is given by
\[
\l(x) = f'(a)(x-a) +f(a).
\]
\end{definition}


Note that $\l(x)$ is just the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x=a$.

A linear approximation of $f$ is a ``good'' approximation as long as
$x$ is ``not too far'' from $a$.
%As we see from Figure~\ref{figure:informal-tangent}, 
If one ``zooms in'' on $f$ sufficiently, then $f$ and the linear
approximation are nearly indistinguishable. As a first example, we
will see how linear approximations allow us to make approximate
``difficult'' computations.

\begin{example}
Use a linear approximation of $f(x) =\sqrt[3]{x}$ at $x=64$ to
approximate $\sqrt[3]{50}$.
\begin{explanation}
To start, write
\[
\ddx f(x) = \ddx x^{1/3} = \frac{1}{\answer[given]{3x^{2/3}}}.
\]
So our linear approximation is
\begin{align*}
\l(x) &= \frac{1}{3\cdot 64^{2/3}} (x-64) + \answer[given]{4} \\
&= \frac{1}{\answer[given]{48}} (x-64) + 4\\
&= \frac{x}{48} +\frac{8}{3}.
\end{align*}
\begin{image}
%\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=1,xmax=100,ymin=0,ymax=5,
            axis lines=center,
            xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]        
          \addplot [very thick, penColor, samples=150,smooth,domain=(0:100)] {x^(1/3))};
          \addplot [very thick, penColor2, domain=(0:100)] {x/48+8/3};
          \addplot [textColor,dashed] plot coordinates {(64,0) (64,4)};
          \addplot [textColor,dashed] plot coordinates {(0,4) (64,4)};
          \node at (axis cs:20,2.3) [penColor] {$f$};
          \node at (axis cs:20,3.3) [penColor2] {$\l$};
          \addplot[color=penColor3,fill=penColor3,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(64,4)};  %% closed hole            
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
%\caption{A linear approximation of $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$ at $x=64$.}
%\label{figure:la sqrt3x}
%\end{marginfigure}
\end{image}
Now we evaluate $\l(50) \approx 3.71$ and compare it to
$\sqrt[3]{50}\approx 3.68$.  From this we see that the linear
approximation, while perhaps inexact, is computationally \textbf{easier}
than computing the cube root.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}


With modern calculators and computing software it may not appear
necessary to use linear approximations. In fact they are quite
useful. In cases requiring an explicit numerical approximation, they
allow us to get a quick rough estimate which can be used as a
``reality check'' on a more complex calculation. In some complex
calculations involving functions, the linear approximation makes an
otherwise intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of
accuracy.




\section{Differentials}

The notion of a \textit{differential} goes back to the origins of
calculus, though our modern conceptualization of a differential is
somewhat different than how they were initially understood.

\begin{definition}
Let $f$ be a differentiable function. We define a new independent
variable $\d x$, and a new dependent variable
\[
\d f=f'(x)\cdot \d x.
\] 
The variables $\d x$ and $\d f$ are called
\dfn{differentials}. Geometrically, differentials can be interpreted
via the diagram below
\begin{image}
%\begin{marginfigure}[0in]
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=1, xmax=2, range=0:6,ymax=6,ymin=0,
            axis lines =left, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            ticks=none,
            axis on top,
          ]         
          \addplot [draw=black,dashed,->,>=stealth'] plot coordinates {(1.4,10/6) (1.7,10/6)};
	  \addplot [draw=black,dashed,->,>=stealth'] plot coordinates {(1.7,10/6) (1.7,10/6 +.3/.36)};
          \addplot [very thick,penColor, smooth,samples=100,domain=(0:1.833)] {-1/(x-2)};
          \addplot[color=penColor3,fill=penColor3,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(1.4,10/6)};  %% closed hole            
          \node at (axis cs:1.55,1.67) [below] {$\d x$};
          \node at (axis cs:1.7,2.08) [right] {$\d f$};
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
%\caption{While $dy$ and $\d x$ are both variables, $dy$ depends on $\d x$,
  %and approximates how much a function grows after a change of size
  %$\d x$ from a given point.}
%\label{figure:differentials}
%\end{marginfigure}
\end{image}
Note, it is now the case (by definition!) that 
\[
\frac{\d f}{\d x} = f'(x).
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
  The differential $\d x$ is:
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$d$ times $x$.}
    \choice[correct]{A single variable.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{question}
    The differential $\d f$ is:
    \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice{$d$ times $f$.}
      \choice[correct]{A single variable that is dependent on $\d x$.} 
    \end{multipleChoice}
  \end{question}
\end{question}

Essentially, differentials allow us to solve the problems presented in
the previous examples from a slightly different point of view. Recall,
when $h$ is near but not equal zero,
\[
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\]
hence, 
\[
f'(x)h \approx f(x+h)-f(x).
\]
Since $h$ is simply a variable, and $\d x$ is simply a variable, we can replace $h$ with $\d x$ to write
\begin{align*}
f'(x)\cdot \d x &\approx f(x+\d x)-f(x)\\
\d f &\approx f(x+\d x)-f(x).
\end{align*}
Adding $f(x)$ to both sides we see
\[
f(x+\d x)\approx f(x) + \d f.
\]
While this is something of a ``sleight of hand'' with variables, there
are contexts where the language of differentials is common. Here is
the basic strategy:
\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node at (0,0) {
      $\underbrace{f(x + \d x)} \approx  \overbrace{f(x)} + \underbrace{\d f}$
    };
    \node at (-1.4,-.7) {\small{what you want}};
    \node at (.3,.7) {\small{what you know}};
    \node at (1.7,-.7) {\small{what you compute}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

We will repeat our previous example using differentials.

\begin{example}
Use differentials to approximate $\sqrt[3]{50}$.
\begin{explanation}
  Set $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$. We want to know $\sqrt[3]{50}$.  Since
  $4^3 = 64$, we set $x=64$.  Setting $\d x=-14$, we have
  \begin{align*}
  \sqrt[3]{50} = f(x + \d x) &\approx  f(x) + \d f\\
  &\approx \sqrt[3]{64} + \d f.
  \end{align*}
  Here we see a plot of $y=\sqrt[3]{x}$ with the differentials above
  marked:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
          xmin=40,xmax=70,ymin=3,ymax=4.5,
          axis lines=center,
          xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
        ]        
        \addplot [very thick, penColor, samples=150,smooth,domain=(0:100)] {x^(1/3))};
        %\addplot [very thick, penColor2, domain=(50:64)] {x/48+8/3};
        %\addplot [textColor,dashed] plot coordinates {(64,0) (64,4)};
        \addplot [draw=black,dashed,->,>=stealth'] plot coordinates {(50,4) (50,3.71)};
        \addplot [draw=black,dashed,->,>=stealth'] plot coordinates {(64,4) (50, 4)};
        \node [above] at (axis cs:57,4) {$\d x$};
        \node [left] at (axis cs:50,3.86) {$\d f$};
        \node [below,penColor3] at (axis cs:64,4) {$(64,4)$};
        \addplot[color=penColor3,fill=penColor3,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(64,4)};  %% closed hole            
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    %\caption{A plot of $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$  along with the differentials $\d x$ and $dy$.}
    \label{figure:diff sqrt3x}
  \end{image}
  Now we must compute $\d f$:
  \begin{align*}
    \d f &= f'(x) \cdot \d x\\
    &= \answer[given]{\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}} \cdot \d x\\
    &= \frac{1}{3\cdot64^{2/3}} \cdot(\answer[given]{-14})\\
    &= \frac{1}{3\cdot64^{2/3}} \cdot(-14)\\
    &= \frac{-7}{24}
  \end{align*}
  Hence $f(50) \approx f(64) + \frac{-7}{24} \approx 3.71$.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}


The upshot is that linear approximations and differentials are simply
two slightly different ways of doing the exact same thing.

\section{Error approximation}

Differentials also help us estimate error in real life settings.

\begin{example}
  The cross-section of a $250$ ml glass can be modeled by the function
  $r(x) = \frac{x^4}{3}$:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        declare function = {f(\x) = (1/3)* pow(\x,4);} ]
      \begin{axis}[
          xmin =-4,xmax=4,ymax=23,ymin=-.2,
          axis lines=center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          axis on top,
        ]
        \addplot [draw=none,fill=fillp!50!white,domain=-2.65:2.65, smooth] {.8*sqrt(2.65^2-x^2)+16.8} \closedcycle;
        \addplot [draw=none,fill=fillp,domain=-2.65:2.65, smooth] {-.8*sqrt(2.65^2-x^2)+16.8} \closedcycle; 
        \addplot [draw=none,fill=white,domain=-2.7:2.7, smooth] {f(x)} \closedcycle;
        \addplot [ultra thick,penColor, smooth,domain=-2.75:2.75] {f(x)};

        \draw[penColor,very thick] (axis cs:0,16.8) ellipse (265 and 20);
        \draw[penColor,very thick] (axis cs:0,19) ellipse (275 and 20);

        \node[black] at (axis cs:2.5,3) {$y=\frac{x^4}{3}$};       
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  At $16.8$ cm from the base of the glass, there is a mark indicating
  when the glass is filled to $250$ ml. If the glass is filled within
  $\pm 2$ millimeters of the mark, what are the bounds on the volume?
  As a gesture of friendship, we will tell you that the volume in
  milliliters, as a function of the height of water in centimeters, $y$,
  is given by
  \[
  V(y) = \frac{2\pi y^{3/2}}{\sqrt{3}}.
  \]
  Note: If you persist in your quest to learn calculus, you will be
  able to derive the formula above like it's no-big-deal.
  \begin{explanation}
    We want to know what a small change in the height, $y$ does to the
    volume $V$.  These small changes can be modeled by the
    differentials $\d V$ and $\d y$. Since
    \[
    \d V = V'(y) \d y
    \]
    and $V'(y) = \answer[given]{\pi \sqrt{3 y}}$ we use the fact that
    $\d y = \pm 0.2$ with $y=\answer[given]{16.8}$ to see
    \[
    \d V = \answer[given]{\pi \sqrt{3 \cdot 16.8}} \cdot 0.2.
    \]
    Hence the volume will vary by at most $\pm\answer[given,tolerance=.01]{4.46062}$
    milliliters.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

\section{New and old friends}

You might be wondering, given a plot $y=f(x)$,
\begin{quote}
  What's the difference between $\Delta x$ and $\d x$? What about
  $\Delta y$ and $\d y$?
\end{quote}
Regardless, it is now a pressing question. Here's the deal: 
\[
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\]
is the \dfn{average rate of change} of $y=f(x)$ with respect to $x$.
On the other hand:
\[
\frac{\d y}{\d x}
\]
is the \dfn{instantaneous rate of change} of $y=f(x)$ with respect to
$x$. Essentially, $\Delta x$ and $\d x$ are the same type of thing,
they are (usually small) changes in $x$. However, $\Delta y$ and $\d
y$ are very different things.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta y$ is the change of $y$ associated to $\Delta x$.
\item $\d y$ is the change in $y$ needed to make the following relation true:
  \[
  \d y = f'(x)\d x
  \]
\end{itemize}
\begin{question}
  Suppose $f(x) = x^2$. If we are at the point $x=1$ and $\Delta x =\d x
  = 0.1$, what is $\Delta y$? What is $\d y$?
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \Delta y = \answer{0.21}\qquad \d y = \answer{0.2}
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\end{question}
Differentials can be confusing at first. However, when you master
them, you will have a powerful tool at your disposal.
