Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley! We should be able to figure some integrals
  geometrically using transformations of functions.
\item[Riley] That sounds like a cool idea.  Maybe, since we know the
  graph of $f(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ is a semicircle, we get an ellipse
  defined on $[-2,2]$ just by stretching the graph of $f$ by a factor
  of $2$ horizontally.  The equation of this ellipse would be
  \[
  g(x) =\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}
  \]
\item[Devyn] Exactly!  So since we know that
  \[
  \int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} \d x = \frac{\pi}{2}
  \]
  geometrically\dots
\item[Riley] And we know that the area under $g$ from $[-2,2]$ is
  twice the under $f$\dots
\item[Devyn and Riley] We must have
  \[
  \int_{-2}^2 \sqrt{1-(x/2)^2} \d x =\pi !
  \]
\item[Devyn and Riley] Jinx!
\item[Devyn] It is kind of like we just stretched out our whole
  coordinate system, and that helped us solve an integral.
\item[Riley] In this case, everything got stretched out by a constant
  factor of $2$ in the horizontal direction.  I wonder if we could
  ever say anything useful about cases where we stretch the $x$-axis
  by a different amount at each point?
\item[Devyn] Whao, that is a wild thought.  That seems really hard.
  Since derivatives measure how much a function stretches a little
  piece of the domain, maybe the derivative will come into play here?
\item[Riley] Hmmmm, but I do not see exactly how.  Maybe we should ask
  our TA about this?
\end{dialogue}

%%Q stretch ellipse just like above

\begin{problem}
  Say we know that
  \[
  \int_1^4 f(x) \d x = 5.
  \]
  Then, using this transformation idea, we can evaluate
  \[
  \int_a^b f(3x+1)\d x
  \]
  if $a= \answer{0}$ and $b=\answer{1}$.  The value of the integral on
  this interval is $\answer{5/3}$.
  \begin{feedback}
    Since we are ``squishing'' the integrand, the integral has a value
    of $5/3$. As food for thought, how do we change the integrand so
    that the two integrals above are equal?
  \end{feedback}
\end{problem}
