After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Understand what information the derivative gives concerning when
  a function is increasing or decreasing.
\item Understand what information the second derivative gives
  concerning concavity of a function.
\item Interpret limits as giving information about functions.
\item Determine how the graph of a function looks based on an analytic
  description of the function.
\end{itemize}
