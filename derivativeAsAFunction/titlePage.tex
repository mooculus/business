  definition of a function.
\item Find the derivative function using the limit definition.
\item Relate the derivative function to the derivative at a point.
\item Explain the relationship between differentiability and continuity.
\item Relate the graph of the function to the graph of its derivative.
\item Determine whether a piecewise function is differentiable.
