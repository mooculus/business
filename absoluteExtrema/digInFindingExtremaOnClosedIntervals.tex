From the previous section, we know that if a function is continuous on a closed interval then it achieves a global maximum and 
global minimum on that interval. If we further know that this function is differentiable on this interval, then we have the following observation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then $f$ has a global maximum at a critical point or an endpoint and a global minimum at a critical point or endpoint
\end{itemize}

We can use this observation in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
\item Find all critical points for $f$ that lie in the given interval
\item Evaluate $f$ at each critical point and at the endpoints
\item The global maximum is the largest value such produced and the global minimum is the smallest such value produced
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that we are evaluating the original function $f$ at the critical points and not $f'$. Moreover, only the critical points that
are contained in the given interval are to be checked.


\begin{example}
Find the global maximums and minimums for the function 
$f(x)=x^3-12x$ over the interval $[-3,5]$
\begin{explanation} 
We begin by finding the critical points for $f$
\[
\ddx f(x)=\answer[given]{3x^2-12}.
\] 
This is defined everywhere and is zero at $x=\pm 2$. So the critical
points are when $x=\pm 2$. 
Now we evaluate $f$ at all critical points as well as the endpoints of this interval.
\begin{align*}
f(-2) &= \answer[given]{16} \\ 
f(2) &= \answer[given]{-16} \\ 
f(-3) &= \answer[given]{9} \\ 
f(5) &= \answer[given]{65} 
\end{align*}
Since the largest value that occurs is $65$, so $65$ is the global maximum for $f$ over $[-3,5]$ and occurs at the endpoint $x=5$. 
The smallest value of $f$ that occurs is $-16$, so $-16$ is the global minimum for $f$ over $[-3,5]$ and occurs at the critical point $x=2$.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Find the global maximums and minimums for the function 
$f(x)=x^3-12x$ over the interval $[-1,3]$
\begin{explanation} 
We begin by finding the critical points for $f$
\[
\ddx f(x)=\answer[given]{3x^2-12}.
\] 
This is defined everywhere and is zero at $x=\pm 2$. So the critical
points are when $x=\pm 2$. Notice that the critical point $x=-2$ is not in the interval $[-1,3]$, therefore we do not check at $x=-2$
Now we evaluate $f$ at all critical points in $[-1,3]$ as well as the endpoints of this interval.
\begin{align*}
f(-1) &= \answer[given]{11} \\ 
f(2) &= \answer[given]{-16} \\ 
f(3) &= \answer[given]{-9} 
\end{align*}
Since the largest value that occurs is $11$, so $11$ is the global maximum for $f$ over $[-1,3]$ and occurs at the endpoint $x=-1$. 
The smallest value of $f$ that occurs is $-16$, so $-16$ is the global minimum for $f$ over $[-1,3]$ and occurs at the critical point $x=2$.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}
